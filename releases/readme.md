i released my projects solutions and a lot of my coding challenges surrounding my engine on my github's repo here:

[URL unfurl="true"]https://github.com/ninekorn/sccs[/URL]

LICENSE:
i decided to release my entire project and development and my creation and my invention under the MIT license since it was the less troublesome license to read for one, and also because a lot of programmers/developers use MIT license in order to let developers around the world learn the work of others as it is a permissive license.

For serious inquiries, you can contact me on my email steve.chasse@gmail.com.

Thank you.
