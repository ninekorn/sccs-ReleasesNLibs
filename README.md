WORKING WITH THE OCULUS RIFT CV1 AND WITHOUT VR FOR MY VIRTUAL DESKTOP SIMILI OVERLAY FOR PLAYING NON COMPETITIVE VIDEO GAMES DUE TO A GRID LIKE VOXEL THAT ACTS AS AN OVERLAY AND IT CAN BE CONSIDERED AN ADVANTAGE FOR PLAYERS USING MY PROGRAM WHEN PLAYING COMPETITIVE GAMES AND YOU MIGHT BE BANNED ON THOSE GAMES. OTHERWISE, IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS FOR VR AND NON-VR VIRTUAL DESKTOP AND VOXEL WORLD. 

developped by steve chassé

i updated my solutions program to only use the ab3d.OculusWrap DLL only.

OCULUS RIFT CV1 only - NOT WORKING YET FOR AS AN OVERLAY IN ELITE DANGEROUS AS I HAVE A HARD TIME MAKING THE STEAMVR OVERLAY WORK -

currently the keyboard is not working and the microsoft windows voice recognition stopped working. I have coded this program and used as reference 
many sources from the internet and normally i try to reference it all when i program.

the username is "9" and the password is "std" for standard. 

List of programs:

sccsv101 - 1st version - using instancing but i ended up discarding that program because there was some stuff that wasn't working as expected. I wanted to build some voxel covid19 cloth objects but they ended up looking a bit more like snowflakes/minesweeper/covid19cells. https://youtu.be/GKVrsqPHaMQ

sccsv11 - 2nd version - decided to modify a couple of things compared to sccsv101 but again, i thought my program architecture was lame.

sccsr12dotnet and sccsr12wpf - 3rd version. console dotnet directx virtual reality.

sccsr12dotnet and sccsr12wpf - 3rd version. showing the instancing capabilities. but in this screenshot i wasn't done with the vr human ik so the above screenshot was my later revision of sccsr12dotnet.

sccsr13dotnet and sccsr13wpf - 4th version. breakable voxel virtual desktop (my normal iteration of the virtual desktop is interactive with the oculus touch but not my breakable virtual desktop iteration)

sccsr14forms - virtual desktop in vr and without vr, with physical mesh voxel keyboard and keyboard keys changing color when pressed for VR only. Without VR there isn't a physical keyboard voxel mesh yet but i think i will add one in the future for using my software when streaming and for viewers of the stream to
visually see where the user of my software clicks on the keyboard, when doing programming and editing tutorials this is a very good way to let viewers know what keys are being pressed when we are working fast to show them which keyboard shortcuts are being used.

I have learned to create my own direct3D c# programs and the main help from being able to get out of unity3d and be independant from unity3D was to code my own programs in C#. It was a sad choice, but back in unity 2017, adding the framework in order to make a virtual desktop from sharpdx was a tough thing to do and i couldn't make it happen. i then chose to learn by myself.

So for developping my softwares, i took this as a reference:
https://github.com/Dan6040/SharpDX-Rastertek-Tutorials
which is based on:
https://www.rastertek.com/tutindex.html
Also, I have implemented in my own way the inverse kinematics using the page here for the upper part of the virtual reality 1st person "controller":
